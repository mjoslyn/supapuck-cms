# supapuck-cms: the core (Astro + Puck + Supabase)

A CMS for small organisation sites: Astro SSR on Netlify, content in Supabase, a Puck visual editor,
and Compose (pages written with Claude from documents, images and links). The code is split into the
core (everything outside `src/site/`) and a site (`src/site/`). This repository holds the core and an
example site; a real site is a fork that replaces `src/site/` (see Upstream and sites).

## Upstream and sites

This repository is the upstream. Each site is its own repository with this one as its `upstream`
remote. Its history starts from this one, with a commit that swaps the example `src/site/` for its own.

- Core changes are made here, committed and pushed, then merged into each site:
  `git fetch upstream && git merge upstream/main`. They merge cleanly as long as the site only changes
  `src/site/`, its own migrations (`supabase/migrations/*_site_*.sql`: the Supabase CLI reads only that
  folder), `AGENTS.md`, `README.md`, its env and its local ports (`supabase/config.toml`).
- All of a site's code and files are in `src/site/`, laid out like the core so each maps onto its
  counterpart: `render/c/` (blocks, as `src/render/c/`), `lib/` (`lib/content/cards.ts` beside
  `src/lib/content/card-presets.ts`), `pages/api/` (endpoints, listed in `routes.json`), `styles/`
  (`tokens.css`, `theme.css`), `public/` (static files, served at the same paths as `public/` by the
  `site-public` integration in `astro.config.mjs`; a site file wins), `scripts/` (the site's own checks)
  and `migrations/` (content migrations). The entry points stay at the top: `config.ts`, `render.ts`,
  `editor.tsx`, `presets.json`, `routes.json`, `moved-paths.json`.
- This file (`CORE.md`) documents the core and belongs to upstream; sites don't edit it. A site's own
  notes go in its `AGENTS.md`, which imports this file.
- A core fix found while working on a site can be made there and sent upstream: commit it on its own
  (core files only), then `git cherry-pick` it here.
- Never import from `src/site/` in core code except through `src/lib/site` (the CSS imports of the
  site's `styles/tokens.css` and `styles/theme.css` in `src/styles/site.css` aside). New core code must not hard-code a site's types, URLs or names.
- Migrations (core and site) are named with the time they were written (`YYYYMMDDHHMMSS_name.sql`).
  One written earlier than a migration a site already applied is out of order: apply it with
  `npx supabase db push --include-all` (locally `migration up --include-all`).
- Content changes (renamed props, moved settings) ship as migrations: see Changing stored content.

## Site config

Everything that differs between sites lives in `src/site/`:

- `config.ts` (`defineSite`, types in `src/lib/site/types.ts`): name, organization, admin email,
  default timezone, default mail sender, the Compose brief, content types (labels, URL `base`, `archive` path,
  `record`/`pageless`/`hidden`, taxonomies (`category`, its main one, and `taxonomies`, any others;
  each gets a term picker in an entry's settings, and collections, the event calendar and bulk actions
  offer them; `taxonomiesOf`), `fields` with `compose` hints, `describe`,
  `logoField`, default `card`, `order`) and taxonomies (label, URL `base`, the type a term page `lists`,
  its terms' own `fields`; `category` and `tag` are required). Core code reads it only through `src/lib/site` (`CONTENT_TYPES`,
  `COMPOSABLE_TYPES`, `LISTABLE_TYPES`, `RECORD_TYPES`, `PAGELESS_TYPES`, `TYPE_BASES`,
  `ARCHIVE_PATHS`, `TAXONOMY_BASES`, `fieldsFor`, `categoryOf`, `termPageType`, `SITE_TZ`): the
  editor's Details, Compose's fields and prompt, permalinks, URL routing (archives, term pages,
  records), collection filters and the admin tabs all follow it.
- `render.ts` (`defineRender`, read through `src/lib/site/render.ts`): `redirect` (the site's old URLs,
  301ed from the catch-all route), `blocks` with label, editor
  category, string renderer, an async `prepare` hook that loads data onto ctx, and optional `types`
  (the entry types a block reads fields from, so the editor offers it only there and in templates);
  `cards` (collection card designs; the first is the default); `archiveQuery` to add search or filters
  to listing pages; `head` (fonts, meta); `pageScripts` for footer scripts.
- `editor.tsx` (`defineEditor`, read through `src/lib/site/editor.ts`): settings `panels` for the
  site's blocks, `settingsFields` and `settingsTitle` for site options under Settings.
- `styles/tokens.css` (design token values, including the role colors the core uses) and `presets.json` (the colors, sizes and spacing the editor
  offers), `styles/theme.css` (the site's styles, imported by `src/styles/site.css`).
- `migrations/index.ts` (`MIGRATIONS`, content migrations run before the core's), `routes.json` (the
  site's own endpoints in `src/site/pages/api/`, added by the `site-routes` integration in
  `astro.config.mjs`), `moved-paths.json` (URL prefixes that moved, 301ed).

Behaviour never keys off content class names: the core uses block settings (entry-image `field` and
`linkField` for a logo or banner field linked to a URL field; an `event-date` block for card dates;
collection `shuffle`, `query.orderBy: 'rand'`, `query.upcoming`, `columns`, `autoplay`). Core blocks
output `c-*` classes; a site's classes in content are only styling hooks for its `theme.css`.
Colors: the core's styles use only role tokens (`--color-text`, `-muted`, `-accent`, `-accent-hover`,
`-dark`, `-on-dark`, `-on-accent` (optional), `-surface`, `-surface-alt`, `-surface-soft`), which the site's `tokens.css` maps
onto its own palette (and re-maps inside dark bands). Content and `presets.json` use the palette names.
Compose's house style comes from the config's `compose`: colors (bands `plain`/`tint`/`soft`/`dark`,
body, on-dark, accent and card; role tokens by default), and shapes and type (`headingFont`, `rule`
between eyebrow and heading, `bodySize`/`bodyWeight`/`bodyLineHeight`, `bandPadding`, `textWidth`,
`wideWidth`, `radius`, `buttonRadius`, `buttonCaps`; the defaults are the original house style).

## Data model

Entries have a `type` (from the site config) and terms a `taxonomy`; custom values live in
`entries.fields` under plain names (the type's `fields`). Events use `start`/`end` (wall-clock in
`timezone`), `all_day`, `cost`, `website`, `venue` (entry id), `featured`, `recurrence`, `schedule`.
Image fields hold media ids. `entries.body_text` is the entry's readable text, filled from its
content by a database trigger (`entry_body_text`), for search and event descriptions. Site-wide values
are in `settings` (`site`, `options`). Schema:
`supabase/migrations/`.

## Components

Content is Puck data (`entries.content`, `templates.content`): items `{ type, props: { id, attrs,
children } }`, rendered by `src/render/c/`: content blocks (`section`, `columns`, `text`, `heading`,
`image`, `buttons`, `list`, `quote`, `cover`, `hero`, `gallery`, `video-gallery`, `embed`, `html`,
`media-text`...), entry fields (`entry-title`, `entry-image`, ...), collections (`collection`,
`collection-items`, `pagination`...), events (`event-date`, `events-calendar`, `event-calendar`,
`event-details`), `form`, and structure (`part`, `pattern`, `reusable`). A site's blocks come from its
`render.ts`. `hero` is a full-bleed image with eyebrow, title, text and two buttons. Galleries hold
image blocks (`gallery`) or embed and video blocks (`video-gallery`) and show them as a grid, masonry
columns or a slider (`display`; a scroll-snap row, buttons and autoplay from
`public/assets/js/gallery-slider.js`); media picked in the panel arrive as `attrs.add` and become
child blocks in `resolveGallery` (`config.tsx`).
Props are clean values: styles as CSS with design tokens (`var(--color-*)`, `var(--space-*)`,
`var(--text-*)`), layouts as `{ type: flow|constrained|row|stack|grid }`.

Patterns (`templates` of type `pattern`) are reusable groups of blocks, inserted from the Patterns tab;
their thumbnails come from `/admin/pattern-preview?slug=`. Any block's settings end with **Save as
pattern** (the block and everything in it): a copy pattern inserts its own blocks, for the page to
change freely; a linked pattern (`root.props.linked`) is placed as a reference whose layout and style
stay the pattern's (editing the pattern changes every page) while each page changes its content:
`{ type: 'pattern', attrs: { slug, linked: true, overrides: { <pattern block id>: { content: ... } } } }`
(`src/lib/content/linked-patterns.ts`; which settings are content: `CONTENT_FIELDS`). In the editor a
linked pattern opens as its blocks (`expandLinked`), locked against moving, removing and adding, each
block's panel showing only its content fields (`src/puck/LinkedPatterns.tsx`); saving stores the
reference and the changed content (`collapseAll`), or an ordinary copy if its blocks no longer match
the pattern; Detach makes the copy on purpose. Globals (the `global` type, placed with the Global
block) share content and style alike.

## Collections and tags

A `collection` lists entries with its settings on the block itself (`src/puck/CollectionPanel.tsx`):
what to show (latest of some types, filtered by category and tags; hand-picked `query.include`; or the
page's own listing), display (grid with desktop/tablet/phone columns, list, slider), card design
(the site's `cards`, `src/lib/content/card-presets.ts`; choosing one replaces the item template via
`resolveCollection` in `config.tsx`; "custom" keeps the blocks), pagination (numbers, previous/next,
load more: `public/assets/js/collection-more.js` fetches the next page URL and appends that
collection's items) and an empty message. Card fields: `entry-title`, `entry-image`, `entry-excerpt`,
`entry-date`, `event-date`, `entry-terms`, `entry-field` (any field as text/link/email/phone/image).
Item, empty and pagination child blocks of older collections still render but aren't in the inserter.
A shuffled collection (`shuffle`) renders part of a pool of up to 48 entries and
`public/assets/js/collection-shuffle.js` picks a new random set on each visit.

Addresses: types without a URL `base` (pages and posts in the example site) all live at `/<slug>/`, so
an address is unique across them (`typesSharingAddresses`, `uniqueSlug`; a typed address another of
those types has is refused on save).

Tags are terms of the `tag` taxonomy on any type: edited in each entry's settings (created on save,
`setEntryTags`), filterable in collections (`query.taxQuery.tag`), listed at `/tag/<slug>/`.

Content > Taxonomies (`src/admin/Terms.astro`, `/api/admin/terms`) manages every taxonomy's terms, a
tab each: terms nested under their parents (tags stay flat), with name, address and template to change,
how many entries use each, its page, Details and Delete. **Details** (`src/admin/TermDetails.tsx`; GET
and PUT `/api/admin/terms`) edits a term's description, featured image (`fields.image`), the taxonomy's
own fields (its `fields` in the site config, under their keys in `terms.fields`) and SEO (`fields.seo`,
as an entry's). `template`, `image` and `seo` are reserved keys. A taxonomy's featured image and SEO
(Settings > Types, `settings.site.taxonomy_meta`) are the defaults for its term pages; `{term}` in its
search title and description is the term's name (`src/lib/page-meta.ts`). On a term page, Featured
image, Title, Excerpt and Field blocks outside a collection show the term: its featured image (else
the taxonomy's), name (linking to its page), description and fields. **Write with Claude** (POST
`/api/admin/meta-compose`, `quickAsk`, `ANTHROPIC_SEO_MODEL`) fills a term's description, search title,
meta description and the taxonomy's fields with a `compose` hint, from its name, its parent, what it
has now, the entries filed under it and optional notes; for a taxonomy (Settings > Types) it writes the
`{term}` title and description patterns. Nothing is saved until the form is. A term can't sit under itself or its children; a
changed address leaves a redirect from the old term page; deleting a term moves its children up.
Terms move by dragging their handle: onto another's top or bottom edge to go beside it, onto its middle
to go under it, or onto Top level; the handle's menu does the same from the keyboard (Move up, Move
down, Move under). Their order among the terms beside them is `terms.sort` (then name), used by the
list, the Filters dropdown and an entry's listed terms (`byTermOrder`).

Term pages: their template is the term's own (Content > Taxonomies, `terms.fields.template`; the terms
under a term share its template, and several ticked terms can be set at once), else
`taxonomy-<taxonomy>-<slug>`, else the taxonomy's (Settings > Types, `settings.site.taxonomy_templates`),
else `taxonomy-<taxonomy>`, `taxonomy`, `archive`, `index` (`templateCandidates`, `termTemplate`). A taxonomy's term pages can be
turned off (Settings > Types, `settings.site.taxonomy_pages_off`, `termPagesOn`): its addresses then
serve a page with that address or Not found, and terms show without links (entry terms, event
categories, search suggestions).

## SEO and social

An entry's SEO settings live in `fields.seo` (`src/lib/seo.ts`; `seo` is a reserved field key): search
title, meta description, share image (media id) and noindex. `src/render/meta.ts` writes the head
tags: description, canonical, robots, Open Graph and Twitter card, falling back to the excerpt, the
featured image and the site's default share image; the home page also gets Organization data with the
social profiles as `sameAs`. Compose includes `seo` in every `build_page` and writes it (marked
`generated`) on each build until someone edits it by hand. The entry settings' SEO section
(`src/puck/SeoForm.tsx`) shows lengths and a search result preview, and Generate asks Claude
(`POST /api/admin/seo`, `ANTHROPIC_SEO_MODEL`, default Haiku 4.5) for the page as it is in the editor.
Term pages (`termSeo`): the search title is the term's, else its taxonomy's (with `{term}` filled in),
also used for the `<title>`; the description the term's SEO description, else its description, else
the taxonomy's; the share image the term's, else its featured image, else the taxonomy's; noindex
from either. A type's listing page has its own featured image and SEO (Settings > Types,
`settings.site.listing_meta`, `listingSeo`): the title (over the calendar's own) and description on
the listing's address only, not on views under it (calendar months and days) or searches in it; the
image and noindex on all of them. A Featured image block on a listing page, outside a collection,
shows its image. Write with Claude (`/api/admin/meta-compose`) writes the title and description from
what it lists.

Settings > Social keeps the site's profiles (`settings.site.social`: network and URL;
`src/lib/social/links.ts`) and the default share image (`share_image`). The `social-links` block
(Layout) shows the profiles as icons (`src/lib/social/icons.ts`, Simple Icons paths, CC0), optionally
with names.

## Types in Settings

Settings > Types sets, per type, the template for its entries and its listing page
(`settings.site.templates`, `src/lib/templates.ts`), and turns listing pages off
(`settings.site.listings_off`; the address then serves a page with that address, if any, or 404; for
events the calendar views go too). An entry's own template (its settings) comes before its type's.
Templates without a Page content block are marked, and choosing one warns that the entry's content
won't show.
A template can have several Page content blocks, each naming a content area (`attrs.area`; `main`, the
default, is the entry's content). Other areas (`sidebar`, `intro`...) are filled in per entry and stored
as slots on its content's root (`root.props["area-<name>"]`, `src/lib/content/areas.ts`); the editor
shows each where the template places it. Saving a template gives a Page content block that repeats an
area the next free name (`area-2`, `area-3`...; `uniqueAreas`), so two never show the same content.

## Content list

The content list has All / Published / Drafts / Trash tabs and bulk actions on the checked rows
(`/api/admin/entries/bulk`): Publish (a placeholder address gets one from the title; untitled entries
are skipped), Move to drafts, Move to trash (not the home page); in the trash, Restore (as drafts) and
Delete permanently. Add a term and Remove a term change the entries' terms at once (the type's
taxonomies, tags and any taxonomy its entries use); a tag also goes into unpublished changes kept aside. **Duplicate** (list rows and the editor header; `src/lib/admin/duplicate.ts`) makes
a draft copy titled "(copy)" with its own address: content with any unpublished changes, fields, tags
and other terms, template, featured image and event dates. Templates, parts and patterns duplicate
from the templates list (`<slug>-copy`).

## Redirects

Settings > Redirects (admins; `/admin/redirects/` forwards there): old address to new (301 or 302), exact or a prefix ending in `*` whose
rest fills a `*` in the target (`src/lib/redirects.ts`, tables `redirects` and `not_found`). Whether a
rule covers an address is decided in one place, `ruleCovers`: an exact rule covers its own path, a
wildcard every path under its prefix. Redirects apply when an address would otherwise be Not found
(`renderRequest`, before the slug guess), so they never hide a live page: the exact rule first, else
the wildcard with the longest prefix (the `wildcard` column; in a PostgREST like pattern `*` means
`%`). Uses are counted (`redirect_hit`). A rule that would lead back to itself is refused
(`loopReason`: a wildcard whose target is under its own prefix). A published entry whose address
changes gets one automatically (`redirectMovedEntry`, from the entries API).

Addresses still not found are logged (`not_found`, via `not_found_hit`; files, admin and probes are
left out; at most 5,000 addresses, those not seen for 30 days making room for new ones) and listed on the screen with Add redirect. Saving a rule clears the entries it covers (for a
wildcard, every entry under its prefix, which can be many); the API returns the cleared paths, and
reports a failed clear rather than hiding it.

## Sync

Settings > Sync (admins; `src/admin/Sync.tsx`, `/api/admin/sync`, `src/lib/sync.ts`; backups on Settings >
Backups) copies content
between this site and another copy of it (production and a local copy), either way: entries of chosen
types (with their terms and unpublished changes), terms of chosen taxonomies, files (media rows and
every storage object: sizes, the kept original, AVIF/WebP copies), templates, parts and patterns,
forms, settings (`site`, `options`; the site icon's files too) and redirects. The other copy is reached
directly with `SYNC_REMOTE_URL`, `SYNC_REMOTE_SERVICE_KEY` and `SYNC_REMOTE_NAME`, so a sync runs from
the copy that has them set (production can't reach a local copy).

- Rows match by id (entries, terms, media, forms: the copies share ids, and a sync keeps them; then
  `sync_reset_ids()` moves the id counters past them), by kind and slug (templates), by key (settings)
  and by old address (redirects). Derived columns (`updated_at`, `body_text`, a redirect's
  `wildcard`) are neither compared nor written.
- Compare (`plan`) lists each group's new, changed and unchanged rows and its conflicts, which are
  left alone: an id that is another row there, an address taken by another row, a parent or featured
  image that isn't there (unless the sync brings it). Each new or changed row can be unticked, and
  **Show differences** opens a line diff of the row as the target has it and as the sync would write it.
- Syncing (`apply`, in batches the screen sends in turn) needs a warning ticked that names the target
  and counts the rows it overwrites. It never deletes.
- Before the first batch, `backup` checks the target can take the sync (not protected, and
  `sync_reset_ids()` there: a copy without the migrations is refused before anything is written) and,
  unless **Save a backup first** (on by default) is unticked, saves a backup in the target's private
  `sync-backups` bucket: the rows the sync overwrites, whole and as they are, and the keys of the rows
  it adds. If that fails, nothing is synced. A key the sync means to add that now exists on the target
  (a row made there since Compare) stops it: compare again. Each batch then records the rows it really
  added beside the backup (`written/<backup name>`).
- **Snapshots**: everything a sync covers on one copy (entries with their terms and unpublished
  changes, terms, media rows, templates, forms, settings `site` and `options`, redirects), in the same
  bucket as `<time>-snapshot-<trigger>.json`. Taken by **Back up now** (`snapshotNow`), before a
  snapshot restore, and on a schedule: `netlify/functions/scheduled-snapshot.mts` runs daily at 07:00
  UTC on the deployed site (not under `astro dev`) and calls `scheduledSnapshot`, which takes one if
  they are on and the last is due (daily or weekly).
- **Backups and snapshots hold rows, not stored images.** A file is backed up as its media row; its
  image files in storage are not, and no restore brings them back.
- **Settings > Backups** (`src/admin/Backups.tsx`) has a panel per copy (this site always, the other
  copy when one is set up): what it
  keeps (`settings.site.sync_backups_keep`, default 10, and `sync_snapshots` { enabled, every, keep },
  default 14; 0 keeps all; each copy's own, never synced or restored; older ones are deleted after
  each new one and when a number is lowered), and each backup to download, restore or delete.
- **Restore** (`restore`): a sync's backup undoes that sync on the copy holding it (the rows it
  overwrote go back, the rows it really added are deleted: those recorded as written, so a sync that
  stopped halfway doesn't take later rows with it); a snapshot puts every row it holds back
  (`snapshotPreview` counts them and the rows made since, which are deleted only with **Also delete**).
  Either way the current state is saved first (`before-restore`, never pruning the backup being
  restored), so a restore can be undone the same way, and the copy's own sync settings stay as they
  are. Rows to delete go first, so rows written back can't clash with them; rows are written 100 at a
  time (a failed batch is retried row by row, reporting only the rows that can't go back), and entries'
  terms and unpublished changes in bulk. Deleting a file deletes its media row only: its stored images
  stay. A form with submissions is never deleted (they would be cut loose from it); the report names
  it. A restore runs as a job, since it outlasts a request and must not be cut off halfway:
  `restoreBackup` queues it (`queueRestore`, a file under `jobs/` in the bucket) and the background
  function `netlify/functions/restore-background.mts` runs it once (`runRestore`; under `astro dev` the
  request does) and clears the page cache; the screen polls `GET /api/admin/sync?restoreJob=<id>`.
- A site with **Protect this site from syncs** on (`settings.site.sync_protected`, set on its own Sync
  tab) refuses every sync into it; settings syncs keep each copy's own protection.

## Search

`/search/?q=` lists the entries whose title, excerpt or body text (`entries.body_text`) contain every
word, ranked by relevance (`Loader.queryRanked`: the phrase in the title, then words in title, excerpt,
text; newest first on ties; punctuation separates words; past 500 matches the newest 500 are ranked), in the types chosen under Settings > Search (`searchTypes`,
`settings.site.search_types`; all types with a page by default). It renders the `search` template
(migration 0021, `src/lib/content/search-template.ts`), else `index`; the page is noindex. The
`search-form` block is a GET form to `/search/`. On any page with a `.c-search-form`, the page shell
adds `public/assets/js/search.js`: live results from `GET /api/search?q=&limit=` (JSON, CDN-cached a
minute) under the field, an ARIA combobox (arrows, Enter, Escape closes only the list). `types=`
narrows the types (any with a page of its own) and `taxonomy=` adds that taxonomy's terms in use; a form
sets these as data attributes (`data-types`, `data-taxonomy`, `data-input`, `data-all`), and picking a
term fires a cancelable `c-search:term` on the form.

## Filters, map and navigation

- **Filters** (`collection-filters`, `src/render/c/filters.ts`): a search box with suggestions, a
  taxonomy's terms as a dropdown and chips, the count and Clear, for the page's listing (archive, term
  or search page). Its query-string names are settings (`searchParam`, `termParam`), so a site keeps
  its old links. `prepare` finds Filters blocks before the main query and `applyFilters` applies them
  (terms with their descendants) before the site's `archiveQuery`; `public/assets/js/collection-filters.js`
  refreshes the listing in place and fires `c-filters:change` ({ taxonomy, ids }). Listed entries whose
  `featured` field is set get `is-featured`.
- **Map** (`map`, `src/render/c/map.ts`, `public/assets/js/map.js`, Leaflet): pins for a type's
  published entries with coordinates (field names are settings), linking to each with its address;
  it can follow a Filters block's taxonomy, show featured entries only until filtered, leave out
  entries with a given field on, and take a centre, zoom and height.
- **Navigation** (`navigation`, `src/render/c/navigation.ts`, `public/assets/js/navigation.js`): the
  menu from Settings > Menu (`settings.options.menu_items`, fields in `src/lib/navigation.ts`): links,
  and panels with a sidebar (heading, links, intro, View all) and cards (entries picked, or the latest
  of a type; upcoming for events); a search button opening the search form; a menu button on small
  screens. Top-level links take the colour of where the block sits; the header part is the box panels
  span. **Site title** (`site-title`): the site's icon and name from Settings, with optional text
  before the name.

## Compose with Claude

`/admin/compose/` and the Compose panel in the page editor (docked beside the canvas; pin keeps it
open) run a saved conversation per page (`compose_sessions`): the editor adds documents (PDF, Word,
text, Markdown), images and videos (uploaded to the media library or multi-selected from it), video
links (YouTube/Vimeo) and web links, and asks for a page or changes. A new conversation can create any
type with a page of its own (`COMPOSABLE_TYPES`); Claude is told what the type is (its `describe`) and
fills its fields (those with a `compose` hint in the site config) from the materials in the plan's
`fields` (`src/lib/compose/entry-fields.ts`) when the entry is created, and later with `update_fields`
(just the changed fields). The editor applies updates to its sidebar form (`LivePage.setFields`),
saved with the page. `src/lib/compose/`: `materials.ts` keeps a registry with stable ids (image-1,
doc-1...; PDFs in the private `compose` bucket, link text fetched once with private addresses refused (`private-address.ts`, a subnet list that also
reads IPv4 addresses written as IPv6; `scripts/checks/private-address.ts`),
images re-encoded to JPEG for Claude); `claude.ts` sends the whole conversation (prompt-cached for an hour: the system prompt and the conversation up to the latest message; the page's current sections and fields follow the cache breakpoint) and
Claude either replies or calls `build_page` with the complete page plan (`spec.ts`); `build.ts` turns
the plan into components in the house style. Blocks built by a conversation carry its id prefix, so
each update replaces only those, in place; hand edits are shown to Claude. With a block selected in
the editor, the panel targets it (or its whole section): Claude answers with `edit_block`;
`src/lib/compose/edit.ts` checks the replacement (known types, kept ids, materials resolved; markup cut
to inline formatting and links, addresses to web/mail/phone/site links and raw HTML never taken from
Claude: `safe-html.ts`, since materials can carry instructions). Claude can
also call `search_site` (`src/lib/compose/site.ts`) to feature the site's own entries. Needs
`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` (optional `ANTHROPIC_MODEL`, default claude-opus-5-5).

A turn runs as a job (`src/lib/compose/job.ts`, table `compose_jobs`) because a build takes 30-90s or
more, past Netlify's request limits: `POST /api/admin/compose` reads the materials, queues the turn and
POSTs `{ jobId, token }` to the background function `netlify/functions/compose-background.mts`
(answers 202, runs up to 15 minutes); under `astro dev` the route runs the job in-process. The runner
claims the job with its token and writes progress and the result or error to the row; the panel polls
`GET /api/admin/compose?job=<id>`; a job silent for 3 minutes or older than 16 is reported as failed.
One turn at a time per conversation (409 otherwise) and two per person (429). Only the latest message
carries its selected block's JSON, and a block over 60,000 characters is refused (400) rather than cut.
Text materials count toward the budget of what is sent in full (`MATERIAL_BUDGET.text`).

## How rendering works

- `src/render/` turns a request into HTML strings: resolve the queried entry/archive and template
  (`page.ts`), `prepare()` all data (queries, media, parts, patterns, site block hooks), render items
  (`engine.ts` and the registry in `blocks/index.ts`, plus the site's blocks), then `texturize` the
  whole output (smart quotes, dashes).
- `src/lib/text/` (texturize, autop, entities), `src/lib/date-format.ts` (PHP-style date formats stored
  in content), `src/lib/media/image.ts` (image markup), `src/lib/permalink.ts`.
- CSS: `src/styles/site.css` (Tailwind, no preflight) imports the site's `tokens.css` and `theme.css`,
  `forms.css` and `events.css`; the page shell links the compiled file. Swiper (sliders)
  and Leaflet (maps) are served from the site, in versioned folders under `public/assets/vendor/`
  (`src/render/vendor.ts`), not a CDN, whose connection would hold up the page; their stylesheets are
  linked only on pages that use them (`ctx.assets`). Scripts are in `public/assets/js/`. A site serves
  its fonts the same way (files in `src/site/public/assets/fonts/`, `@font-face` in its `theme.css`, the
  first faces preloaded from its `render.ts` `head`).
- Pages are cached at the CDN through Astro's route cache (`cache` in `astro.config.mjs`, the Netlify
  provider; `src/lib/cache.ts`): fresh for 60s, then served stale for up to a week while they refresh,
  in Netlify's durable cache (shared by its edge servers), tagged `pages`. A successful admin write
  (POST, PUT, PATCH or DELETE under `/api/admin/`) clears that tag from the middleware
  (`cache.invalidate`; a 2xx answer, or the 303 a form post such as a bulk action answers with), so edits show at once; previews, Claude drafting, accessibility marks,
  submissions, users and sync requests other than a sync into this copy or a restore don't
  (`changesPages`). A failed purge is logged and the edit shows within the minute. Under `astro dev`
  nothing is cached. The first cover or hero image on a page loads at high priority (`optimizeImages`).
  Signed-in editors get an editor bar
  (`public/assets/js/editor-bar.js`, `/api/admin/me`) added in the browser, so cached pages stay shared.

## Media

Uploads (`/api/admin/media`) are processed by `src/lib/media/process.ts` (sharp): images over 2560px get
a `-scaled` copy as the full size, the standard sizes are generated (hard crops centred on the focal
point), and every file gets AVIF and WebP copies next to it. An SVG is stored as uploaded. It can carry script and
`/media/` is the site's own address, so every `/media/` answer carries `Content-Security-Policy:
sandbox` and `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` (`MEDIA_HEADERS`; the edge function in production): a
file opened on its own can't run script, and images in pages are unaffected. `media.focal_point` ({x, y} in 0..1) is set
in the media library, with optional overrides per crop shape (`media.crop_focals`: square, 16:9, 4:3,
3:4; `src/lib/media/focal.ts`). Changes re-crop the cropped sizes; the point for the nearest shape
becomes `object-position` wherever the image is cropped to a ratio. Each shape can also use another
image instead (`media.crop_images`: { shape: { id, focal } }, set from the crop previews): wherever the image
is cropped to that shape (a block's aspect ratio, or the square thumbnail size), `mediaImage` shows the
other one, with the focal point set for that use (else its own) and its alt text (else this one's). `Loader.loadMedia` loads them with
the image (`crop_media`, one level). In the media library, with a replaced shape chosen, the panel
shows the other image and clicks set the focal point for that use (kept in `crop_images`; the other
image's own focal points are untouched). Images render as `<picture>` with
AVIF/WebP sources; `src/lib/media/modernize.ts` does the same for plain `/media/` images and inline
backgrounds in the final HTML. Existing media: `scripts/media-formats.ts` backfills the copies
(`processed_at` marks done).

Stored images are never deleted or overwritten by the CMS: the library has no delete, a restore that
removes a file's library row leaves its images in storage (backups hold rows, not images, so undoing
the restore finds them again), and an upload takes a name no library row or stored file already starts
with. Re-crops rewrite only the cropped sizes, which can be made again from the original.

## Forms

Form builder at `/admin/forms/` (`src/forms/FormBuilder.tsx`). Forms live in the `forms` table
(`src/lib/forms/types.ts`: fields with ids like `f1`, widths on a 12-column grid, conditional logic,
confirmation), notification settings in a column anon can't read. The markup comes from
`src/render/forms/form.ts` (styles `src/styles/forms.css`; `public/assets/js/forms.js` runs conditional
logic, US phone formatting and character counters; everything is validated on the server). Place forms
with the `form` block. Submissions POST back to the page (`src/lib/forms/submit.ts`: validation that
skips fields hidden by conditional logic, honeypot, limits (an answer is cut at 10,000 characters, a
form takes 20 submissions a minute, then answers 429), storage, notifications to the form's addresses or
`FORMS_ADMIN_EMAIL` / the config's `adminEmail`). A notification's email is built in the email builder
(`src/forms/EmailBuilder.tsx`, opened by Edit email): a Puck document (`Notification.design`) of email
blocks (Heading, Text, Button, Image, Form field (one answer, or all as a table), Section, Two columns,
Divider, Spacer) that `src/lib/forms/email.ts` renders to email-safe HTML (tables, inline styles, a 600px
body, a preheader, columns stacking on phones; text kept to paragraphs, emphasis, links and lists), the
canvas included. Its Plain text tab (`Notification.text`, merge tags allowed) is the text part; empty,
the text is made from the HTML. Its Preview tab renders the email as sent (`renderNotification`, the
code that sends it) for a stored submission or sample answers (`/api/admin/forms/<id>/notification-preview`).
Notifications from before the builder send their message as before until opened there. Mail goes out over SMTP
(`SMTP_HOST`/`SMTP_PORT`/`SMTP_USER`/`SMTP_PASS`/`SMTP_SECURE`, or one `SMTP_URL`; sender `MAIL_FROM`,
default `mailFrom` in the site config).

## Events

`src/lib/events/model.ts` loads events (occurrences included) as `CalEvent`s;
`src/render/events/calendar.ts` renders the `events-calendar` block, `event-calendar.ts` the month
grid / list block for any page (`public/assets/js/event-calendar.js`) and `single.ts` the
`event-details` block (styles `src/styles/events.css`). URLs: `/events/` (upcoming list),
`/events/past/`, `/events/month/<Y-m>/`, `/events/day/<Y-m-d>/`, with `?q=` search and `?from=<Y-m-d>`.
Feeds (`src/lib/events/ical.ts`): `/events.ics` (same `q`, `month`, `past` filters) and
`/event/<slug>/[<Y-m-d>/]event.ics`; they describe `SITE_TZ` from the runtime's time zone data
(`src/lib/events/timezone.ts`) and are cached at the CDN like pages. The month and day views link no
further than the first and last event (and today); a view outside that range is noindex.

The site timezone (`SITE_TZ`) is set by admins under Settings (`settings.site.timezone`; the config's
`timezone` is the default). It is a live binding in `src/lib/site`: the middleware and compose jobs
refresh it from the settings (`src/lib/site/timezone.ts`, cached a minute), admin pages pass it to
the browser as `window.__siteTz`. Changing it moves events that were on the old timezone to the new
one with their local times kept (`moveEventsToTimezone`); events with their own timezone stay.

Recurrence (`src/lib/recurrence.ts`): an event's rule is stored in `fields.recurrence` and edited in
the event sidebar. Occurrences are virtual entries (negative ids, own `event_start`/`start`/`end`) at
`/event/<slug>/<Y-m-d>/`; `/event/<slug>/` redirects to the next one. `Loader.query` expands series
only when a recurring event exists (for an upcoming list, only series and events still to start are
loaded). A series is expanded to the horizon (two years ahead); of a long
one the newest 1,100 occurrences are kept. Saving an event rewrites the `start`/`end` fields the views read.

## Editor

`/admin/` (Supabase Auth; `profiles.role`: editor, admin, or viewer = no access). Editors manage content,
templates, media, forms and compose; site settings and users (`/admin/users/`: roles, invitations) are
for admins, as is the redirects API (`ADMIN_ONLY` in `src/middleware.ts`; settings writes are admin-only in RLS via
`is_admin()`; the users API checks the role itself too, since invitations use the service key). `src/puck/Editor.tsx` renders blocks through the same string renderer inside Puck
(`BlockView.tsx` parses HTML to React; slots become the block's inner wrapper element). The left rail
has Blocks (and Patterns), Outline and an accessibility check (`A11yPanel.tsx`). Problems a person has to judge
(warnings, and text over an image, which is always a problem since its contrast can't be measured) can be
marked as checked with a note; the marks live in the document's root props (`a11y`), save on their own as
they are made (`PUT /api/admin/a11y`; not an unsaved edit), and lapse when the text or image they were about changes. Blocks with `types`
are offered only on those entry types. Pages whose template has no `post-content` are edited in layout
mode: the template document itself. In content mode the template around the page's content shows as it
will on the site; for admins, hovering one of its blocks, a template part or a pattern outlines it with a
link to edit that template, part or pattern in a new tab (`markSources`, `SourceLinks`; globals get none).

Admin colors and logo (Settings > Admin, `settings.site.admin_theme`, `src/lib/admin-theme.ts`): accent,
text, menu bar and background, and a logo for the menu bar in place of the site name (or beside it,
`logo_name`; a media id, whose URL the settings API makes from the media row), previewed as they are
picked. Admin styles use only the role tokens
`--color-admin-*` (`src/styles/tailwind.css`; Tailwind colors like `text-admin-muted`), never hex
values; `src/layouts/AdminTheme.astro` writes the saved colors and the shades made from them (darker
accent, soft background, the bar's text) on every admin page, and Puck's blue scale is made from the
accent (`src/styles/admin.css`). The admin uses the system font (`--font-admin`).

Saving: **Save draft** keeps changes to a published page aside (table `entry_drafts`, editors only:
published rows of `entries` are public) with the live page
unchanged; unpublished pages save in place as drafts. **Publish** / **Publish changes** makes them live;
the header also offers Discard changes and Unpublish (`PUT /api/admin/entries/:id` with `action`).
**Preview** opens `/admin/preview/<id>/` with the editor's current state (POST) or the saved draft
(GET), rendered like the site with a preview bar and noindex. Templates and layout mode have no drafts:
"Save & apply" changes every page using them. A save says which stored version it is based on (`base`,
the `updated_at` the editor loaded; `templateBase` in layout mode): if someone else saved since, it is
refused with 409 (`isStale`) and the editor asks before saving over their version. Each save and
accessibility mark answers with the new `updated_at`. Tags and terms are linked new-first, then the
others removed (`setLinks`), and a tag two saves create at once is made once.

Record types (`record: true`, such as venues) are data only: `/admin/edit/<id>/` shows a plain form for
them (`src/puck/RecordEditor.tsx`) with the entries that use them. An `entry` field (`EntryField` in
`src/puck/entry-fields.tsx`) picks one: search, clear, or add a new one inline. `POST
/api/admin/entries` creates entries (form post from the list: untitled draft; JSON from pickers:
titled, returns the id).

## Hosting

Netlify, with a hosted Supabase project (`npx supabase link`). Migrations: `npx supabase db push
--linked`; SQL: `npx supabase db query --linked`. Hosted projects don't grant the API roles access to
new tables (the local stack does): migration 0019 grants them and sets default privileges, and RLS
does the rest. `scripts/copy-storage.ts` copies storage objects from the local stack to a hosted
project (resumable). Editors set their password at `/admin/set-password/` (invitation and reset links
land there), so Supabase Auth's Site URL and redirect URLs must include the site's domain. Env:
`.env.example`.

## Commands

```
npx supabase start                      # local stack (ports in supabase/config.toml)
npx astro dev --background              # http://localhost:4321
npx tsx --env-file=.env scripts/create-editor.ts you@example.org 'password' [editor|admin]   # a user
npm run seed                            # starter templates, home page, sample event (skips what exists)
npx tsx --env-file=.env scripts/migrate-content.ts [--dry-run]   # site then core content migrations
npx tsx scripts/checks/formatting.ts    # autop/texturize against scripts/checks/formatting-cases.json
npx tsx scripts/checks/recurrence.ts    # recurrence rules, DST, event date sync
npx tsx --env-file=.env scripts/media-formats.ts   # backfill AVIF/WebP for existing media
```

`.github/workflows/check.yml` runs `npm run check`, the two checks above and `scripts/checks/private-address.ts` on every push and pull
request.

`scripts/safety-e2e.ts` (uploads, form limits, shared addresses, stale saves, tags, search, roles, restore as a job) and
`scripts/sync-e2e.ts` (a sync stopped by a row made since Compare; undoing a half-finished sync; needs
a second local stack as `SYNC_REMOTE_*`) use the running site without a browser and remove what they make.

The e2e scripts (`scripts/*-e2e.ts`, `scripts/checks/compose.ts`) sign in as `LOCAL_ADMIN_EMAIL` /
`LOCAL_ADMIN_PASSWORD` and were written against a site with content (pages, events, venues, members);
on the example site some need that content first.

## Changing stored content

Content changes the core or a site needs (renamed props, moved settings, switched block types) ship as
a content migration or a SQL migration that edits the JSON. Content migrations are the core's
(`migrateCollectionLayout` in `src/lib/content/collections.ts` is one) and the site's
(`src/site/migrations/`); `scripts/migrate-content.ts` runs the site's first, then the core's.

- Walk the JSON properly (PL/pgSQL or TypeScript): the key order of stored blocks varies, so text
  patterns miss some.
- Keep updated dates: disable the `*_touch` triggers around the update.
- Name migrations with the time they are written (`YYYYMMDDHHMMSS_name.sql`; a site's
  `YYYYMMDDHHMMSS_site_name.sql`).
- When a migration switches block types or settings, the new code and the database change must land
  together: push the code, wait for the deploy, then `npx supabase db push --linked` at once (the
  pages break in between).

## Checking changes

- Render the affected pages before and after and diff the HTML for unintended changes (ignore
  cache-busting `?v=` values and shuffled collections); look at screenshots (desktop and phone) of
  intended ones. Lazy-loaded images need the page scrolled before a full-page screenshot.
- Browser tests use Playwright from a script inside the project (so imports resolve), signing in as
  `LOCAL_ADMIN_EMAIL` / `LOCAL_ADMIN_PASSWORD` from `.env`; POSTs to Astro need an `Origin` header
  (CSRF check). The editor canvas is `iframe#preview-frame`; blocks that can't be dragged report as
  disabled, so tests click them with `force`.
- Checks that need one site's content live in that site's `src/site/scripts/`.

## Rules

- Check changes against the site's own output (see Checking changes).
- Name code, data, URLs and classes for what they are here, not after another system's names.
- Section and loop markup is followed by autop; keep the whitespace in those templates as it is.
