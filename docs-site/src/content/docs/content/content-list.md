The admin content list has **All**, **Published**, **Drafts** and **Trash** tabs, a tab per type,
and bulk actions on the checked rows (`/api/admin/entries/bulk`).

## Bulk actions

| Action | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| Publish | A placeholder address gets one from the title; untitled entries are skipped |
| Move to drafts | Unpublishes |
| Move to trash | Not the home page |
| Restore | In the trash: back as drafts |
| Delete permanently | In the trash |
| Add a term, Remove a term | Changes the entries' terms at once: the type's taxonomies, tags, and any taxonomy its entries use. A tag also goes into unpublished changes kept aside |

## Duplicate

**Duplicate** (list rows and the editor header; `src/lib/admin/duplicate.ts`) makes a draft copy
titled "(copy)" with its own address: content with any unpublished changes, fields, tags and other
terms, template, featured image and event dates.

Templates, parts and patterns duplicate from the templates list (`<slug>-copy`).

## Records

Record types (`record: true`, such as venues) are data only: `/admin/edit/<id>/` shows a plain form
(`src/puck/RecordEditor.tsx`) with the entries that use them. An `entry` field picks one: search,
clear, or add a new one inline (`EntryField` in `src/puck/entry-fields.tsx`).

`POST /api/admin/entries` creates entries: a form post from the list makes an untitled draft; JSON
from pickers makes a titled one and returns its id.
