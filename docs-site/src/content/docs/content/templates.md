## Templates per type

**Settings > Types** sets, for each type, the template for its entries and for its listing page
(`settings.site.templates`, `src/lib/templates.ts`). An entry's own template (in its settings) comes
before its type's.

Templates without a **Page content** block are marked, and choosing one warns that the entry's content
won't show. Pages whose template has no Page content are edited in layout mode: the template document
itself.

Each listing page also has its own featured image and SEO there (see
[SEO and social](../../features/seo-and-social/#listing-pages)).

Listing pages can be turned off (`settings.site.listings_off`). The address then serves a page with
that address, if any, or 404. For events, the calendar views go too.

Templates and layout mode have no drafts: **Save & apply** changes every page that uses them.

## Content areas

A template can have several Page content blocks, each naming a content area (`attrs.area`). `main`,
the default, is the entry's content. Other areas (`sidebar`, `intro`...) are filled in per entry and
stored as slots on its content's root (`root.props["area-<name>"]`, `src/lib/content/areas.ts`). The
editor shows each where the template places it.

Saving a template gives a Page content block that repeats an area the next free name (`area-2`,
`area-3`...; `uniqueAreas`), so two never show the same content.

## Patterns

Patterns (`templates` of type `pattern`) are reusable groups of blocks, inserted from the editor's
Patterns tab. Their thumbnails come from `/admin/pattern-preview?slug=`.

Any block's settings end with **Save as pattern** (the block and everything in it).

- **Copy pattern**: inserts its own blocks, which the page changes freely.
- **Linked pattern** (`root.props.linked`): placed as a reference. Layout and style stay the
  pattern's, so editing the pattern changes every page; each page changes only its content.

A linked pattern is stored as:

```json
{
  "type": "pattern",
  "attrs": {
    "slug": "visit-cta",
    "linked": true,
    "overrides": { "<pattern block id>": { "content": "..." } }
  }
}
```

In the editor a linked pattern opens as its blocks (`expandLinked`), locked against moving, removing
and adding, each block's panel showing only its content fields (`CONTENT_FIELDS`,
`src/lib/content/linked-patterns.ts`, `src/puck/LinkedPatterns.tsx`). Saving stores the reference and
the changed content (`collapseAll`), or an ordinary copy if its blocks no longer match the pattern.
**Detach** makes the copy on purpose.

## Globals

Globals (the `global` type, placed with the Global block) share content and style alike: one edit
changes every place it appears.

## Template parts

Parts (`part` block) such as the header and footer are shared regions of templates.
