## Uploads

Uploads (`/api/admin/media`) are processed by `src/lib/media/process.ts` with sharp:

- Images over 2560px get a `-scaled` copy, used as the full size.
- The standard sizes are generated, hard crops centred on the focal point.
- Every file gets AVIF and WebP copies next to it.
- An SVG is stored as uploaded. It can carry script and `/media/` is served from the site's own
  address, so every `/media/` answer carries `Content-Security-Policy: sandbox` and
  `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`: a file opened on its own can't run script.

## Focal points

`media.focal_point` (`{ x, y }` in 0..1) is set in the media library, with optional overrides per crop
shape (`media.crop_focals`: square, 16:9, 4:3, 3:4; `src/lib/media/focal.ts`). Changing them
re-crops the cropped sizes. Wherever an image is cropped to a ratio, the point for the nearest shape
becomes its `object-position`.

## A different image for a crop

Some photos don't crop well to every shape: a tall portrait makes a poor wide banner. Under each crop
preview in the media library, **Use another image** picks a different image from the library for that
shape. Wherever the image is shown cropped to that shape (a block with that aspect ratio, a card, the
square thumbnail size), the other image shows instead, with its own focal point; **Remove** goes back to
the image itself. With that shape chosen above the image, the panel shows the other image: clicking it
sets its focal point for this crop, saved with Save. That point applies only where it stands in for this
image; the other image's own focal points are untouched. Shapes are matched within 15%, so 16:10 counts as wide; crops that aren't one of the four shapes
(3:1, say, or a height with no ratio) keep the image itself.

## Markup

Images render as `<picture>` with AVIF and WebP sources (`src/lib/media/image.ts`).
`src/lib/media/modernize.ts` does the same for plain `/media/` images and inline backgrounds in the
final HTML.

## Images are never deleted

The CMS never deletes or overwrites a stored image. The library has no delete; a sync restore or snapshot
restore that removes a file's library row leaves its images in storage; and an upload takes a name that
no library row or stored file already starts with, so it can't overwrite images kept that way. Re-crops
rewrite only the cropped sizes, which can be made again from the original. Backups hold library rows,
not images (see [Sync](../sync/#backups-and-snapshots)).

## Existing media

`scripts/media-formats.ts` backfills the AVIF and WebP copies; `processed_at` marks the files done.

```sh
npx tsx --env-file=.env scripts/media-formats.ts
```
